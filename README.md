# ChIP-seq

In this study, I analyse a publicly available ChIP-seq. The.ipynb file describes the data source, the biological system, and the interpretation of the results.

I perform a 'straight' ChIP-seq experiment for a transcription factor, including mapping, QC, peak calling, motif discovery, target gene analysis, and I perform a contrast between two conditions, followed by the analysis of the differential peaks (again, using motif discovery and target gene analysis).
